# Chore Manager Application

Welcome to the Chore Manager Application! This project will help us learn the basics of programming while building an app to manage chores at home. We'll be using Next.js, a powerful framework for building web applications.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that makes it easy to build fast and user-friendly web applications. It comes with features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and a lot more out of the box.

## Project Structure

Here's a quick overview of the project's structure and what each folder/file does:

- **`app`**: This is where we create our application pages and components.
  - **`favicon.ico`**: The favicon for your app.
  - **`globals.css`**: Global CSS file for styling.
  - **`layout.tsx`**: The main layout component for your application.
  - **`Page_Example`**: Directory containing the page `page.tsx` which is rendered at `localhost:3000/Page_Example`.
  - **`page.module.css`**: CSS module for styling the main page.
  - **`page.tsx`**: The main page of the application, rendered at `localhost:3000`.

- **`public`**: This folder is used for static assets like images, fonts, etc. Anything you put in here can be accessed directly in the browser.
  - **`next.svg`**: Example image file.
  - **`vercel.svg`**: Example image file.

- **`LICENSE`**: The license file for your project.
- **`next.config.mjs`**: Configuration file for Next.js.
- **`next-env.d.ts`**: TypeScript environment definitions for Next.js.
- **`package.json`**: This file contains metadata about our project, like the project name, version, and dependencies. It also has scripts to run and build our application.
- **`package-lock.json`**: Automatically generated file that helps with package version consistency.
- **`README.md`**: The file you are reading right now.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and Yarn installed. If not, you can install them by following the instructions above.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chore-manager-app.git
cd chore-manager-app
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your application running.

### Adding a New Page

1. Go to the `app` folder.
2. Create a new directory with the name of your new page, for example, `New_Page`.
3. Inside this directory, create a file named `page.tsx`.
4. Add the following code to your new file:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const NewPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>New Page</h1>
      <p>This is a new page.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default NewPage;
```

5. Save the file and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/New_Page` in your browser to see your new page.

## Explanation of Important Files

### `package.json`

This file holds various metadata relevant to the project and is used to manage the project's dependencies, scripts, version, and more.

- **Dependencies**: Libraries and frameworks our project needs.
- **Scripts**: Commands that help us run, build, and test our application.

### `node_modules`

This folder contains all the packages (libraries and frameworks) that our project depends on. It's generated automatically when we install dependencies.

### `public`

This folder is for static files like images, fonts, and other assets. Files here can be accessed directly via a URL. For example, `public/next.svg` can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000/next.svg`.

### `app`

This is where we define our application's pages and components. Each directory within `app` corresponds to a route in our application.

### `tsconfig.json`

This file contains TypeScript configuration options that control the compiler settings for our project.
